# Fafnir
Fafnir is a simple malware program that enrypts all files important for Windows with an XOR cipher.

## Dangerous Features
I haven't decided how far I want to go with this.

## Development Builds
Development builds are in the [broken](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Fafnir/tree/broken) branch.

## More coming soon!
